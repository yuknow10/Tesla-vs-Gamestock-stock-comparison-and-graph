# Tesla-vs-Gamestock-historical- stock prices-and-revenue
In this project, I compared Tesla and Game stop historical stock price and revenue and built a dashboard to compare the two stocks.

This project aims to provide data-driven insights for investors interested in comparing the historical revenue and stock price of Tesla and GameStop. I place myself as a data scientist working for an investment firm, and extracted revenue data for both companies and build a dashboard that allows users to compare their respective stock prices with their revenue.

The dashboard was built using Python, Pandas, beautifulsoup and Plotly. The revenue data was extracted using web scraping techniques from publicly available financial reports. The extracted data was then cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed using Pandas. 
The analysis include visualizations that highlight the revenue trends for both companies over time.


Overall, this project will provide investors with a data-driven approach to compare the revenue and stock prices of Tesla and GameStop, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the insights provided by the dashboard.
